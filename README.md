## Introduction

EventZea is a Web3 application that allows creators to create events and users to buy event tickets, it also gives users the ability to sell their tickets at any amount they want. Event creator can view their earnings and withdraw their earnings whenever they want. Payment from tickets of users that listed their tickets are received directly into their wallets. Event creators can use the event check page to verify those who are attending their event. The ticket can only be purchased with BUSD (stable coin), this is to prevent instability in price.

The smart contract takes 10% of any ticket sales.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
